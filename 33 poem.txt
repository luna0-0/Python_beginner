*#*@*$, *#*@*$, little star,
how i wonder what you are!
up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky.

when the *#*@*$ sun is gone,
when he nothing shines upon,
then you show your little light,
*#*@*$, *#*@*$, all the night.

then the traveler in the *#*@*$
thanks you for your tiny spark,
how could he see where to go,
if you did not *#*@*$ so?

in the *#*@*$ blue sky you keep,
often through my curtains *#*@*$
for you never shut your eye,
till the sun is in the sky.

as your bright and tiny spark
lights the traveler in the *#*@*$,
though i know not what you are,
*#*@*$, *#*@*$, little star.
